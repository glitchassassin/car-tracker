# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

## Features

- üöÄ Server-side rendering
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- üì¶ Asset bundling and optimization
- üîÑ Data loading and mutations
- üîí TypeScript by default
- üéâ TailwindCSS for styling
- üß™ End-to-end testing with Playwright
- üìñ [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Previewing the Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

This project includes end-to-end testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### Running Tests

Run all e2e tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run tests in UI mode (interactive):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Run tests in debug mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

View test report:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` and located in the `tests/e2e/` directory. The configuration includes:

- **Multi-browser testing**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Mobile testing**: Tests run on mobile viewports (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- **Automatic dev server**: Starts the development server before running tests
- **Screenshots and videos**: Captured on test failures
- **Trace collection**: Available for debugging failed tests

### Writing Tests

Tests are written using Playwright's test framework. Example:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should load the homepage', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Car Tracker');
  await expect(page.getByText("What's next?")).toBeVisible();
});
```

### CI/CD Integration

E2E tests run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline:
- Tests run in parallel with the build job
- Both test and e2e-tests jobs must pass before deployment
- Test artifacts (reports, screenshots, videos) are uploaded for debugging

## Deployment

This project supports automatic deployment with environment-specific builds using the [Cloudflare wrangler-action](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action):

### Setup Requirements

To enable automatic deployments, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID

### Production Deployment

Production deployment happens automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The app is deployed to the production environment.

To deploy manually to production:

```sh
npm run deploy -- --env production
```

### Preview Deployments

When you create a pull request, the CI/CD pipeline automatically:

1. **Uploads a preview version** - Each PR gets uploaded as a tagged version (`pr-{number}`) to Cloudflare
2. **Comments on the PR** with instructions to deploy the preview version for testing
3. **No cleanup required** - Preview versions are managed through Cloudflare's versioning system

#### Preview Features:
- **Tagged versions**: Each PR creates a version tagged with `pr-{number}`
- **On-demand deployment**: Deploy preview versions when needed for testing
- **Version management**: All preview versions are managed through Cloudflare's dashboard
- **Simple workflow**: No complex environment configuration or cleanup

#### Manual Preview Deployment

To deploy a preview version for testing:

```sh
# Upload a preview version (done automatically by CI/CD)
npm run deploy:preview
# or with a custom tag:
npx wrangler versions upload --tag my-feature

# Upload and immediately deploy a preview version
npm run deploy:preview-now

# Deploy a specific version
npx wrangler versions deploy --x-versions

# Promote a version to production
npx wrangler versions deploy [version-id]
```

#### Using Preview URLs

Preview URLs are managed through:
- **Cloudflare Dashboard**: Access version management and preview URLs
- **Wrangler CLI**: Deploy and manage versions locally
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic version uploads on PR creation

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
